            <p> Torr is an artist who operates in the world of Hyperpop. I actaully know Torr personally from when he attended the NYU Music Tech program, which he graduated from in the spring. His sound is more inspired by 2000s pop punk, SoundCloud trap music, and indie music. A lot of his songs feature the same metalic snare Sophie popularized. Here's his single "NPC" from earlier this year:

            <p> Another duo making waves in the Hyperpop scene is Food House. They're signed to Dog Show Records, the label run by Dylan Brady of 100 Gecs. Comprised of vocalist Fraxiom and producer Gupi (who is actually Tony Hawk's son), Food House made it big in 2018 with their song "Thos Moser". The song referenced the 100 Gecs show that NYU hosted in October of 2019 and went viral. Their debut album "Food House" came out earlier this month. You can hear the song "Ride" from that album above.

                <p> Six Impala is another group making some great hyperpop. Comprised of six producers who met in the SoundCloud electronic music scene, thier album "WFLYTD" was their first to feature their newest member NEUTRA on vocals. Their style is more influenced by rave music and bubblegum bass, a genre that SOPHIE also operated in. Their song "Toy Car" is a great example of the heavily effected vocals and eclectic song arrangement that 100 Gecs popularized.
