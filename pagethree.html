        <h2>Hyperpop Goes Big</h2>

            <section>
                <p> So A. G. Cook and SOPHIE's work as producers for Charli XCX originated the blend of experimental electronic dance music and pop that would later become Hyperpop, but who really popularized Hyperpop as a genre? That would have to be the group 100 Gecs. Comprised of Dylan Brady and Laura Les, 100 Gecs were the first group to go mainstream with music that wasn't just Pop with electronic elements, but a genre unto itself. 100 Gec's music featured a dizzying blend of Pop, Pop Punk, Ska, Metal, Trap, Dubstep, House, and Plunderphonics. This sound was what defined their EP "1000 Gecs", and gained them viral noteriety online. Their music featured the high-pitched vocals, metalic snares, and abraisive synths that Sophie pioneered, but added a level of grit and distortion that wasn't present in A. G. Cook and Sophie's polished Pop music.

                    <p> After the popularity boom of "1000 Gecs", Spotify started a playlist of 100 Gecs and their contemporaries called "Hyperpop". This served as a validation of the genre as a whole and further launched it into the maintstream. Now in 2020, Hyperpop has become a scene unto itself and there are many artists putting their own spin and interpretaion on the Hyperpop style. Head over to the next page to hear some music from Hyperpop artists.
