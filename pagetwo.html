        <h2>The Origins of Hyperpop Cont.</h2>

        <section>
          <p> Sophie is another artist attributed to defining the sound of Hyperpop. Sophie's debut album "Product" came out in 2015 and featured a blend of dance music, trap, and pop. Specifically, the song "Lemonade" featured rubbery electronic synth sounds that would become a signature for Sophie as a producer. The track "MSMSMSMSM" also featured a snare sound that resembled a pan being hit with a spoon that would later become a staple of Sophie's sound and of the Hyperpop genre at large. Sophie worked with A. G. Cook on a music project called QT that released only one song called "Hey QT". The work that brough Sophie's sound to the mainstream though was also her work with Pop singer Charli XCX on the "Vroom Vroom" EP. The track "Vroom Vroom" featured the same rubbery synths and pot hit snare as Sophie's earlier work. The wide appeal of Charli XCX lead to many people being exposed to this wilder, more exoerimental side of Charli XCX's music, and what would later become the Hyperpop sound.
