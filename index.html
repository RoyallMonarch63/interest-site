        <h2>The Origins of Hyperpop</h2>

        <section>
            <p> Welcome to my website about Hyperpop! I'm just gonna talk about some cool Hyperpop music and probably have some links to some songs I like. So what is Hyperpop? Simply put it's pop music with electronic production that draws from multiple genres for influence. Some songs have trap rap influence, some songs have a pop punk influence, some have dubstep influence. It's really a genre that can be anything the artist wants it to be. The term Hyperpop is less of a true genre and more of an umbrella term for experimental electronic pop.</p>

            <p> So how did Hyperpop start? Well two artists who are credited for developing the sound of the genre are A. G. Cook and Sophie. In 2013, A. G. Cook started a label called "PC Music" that released pop music with an experimental edge that embraced cyberculture, dance music culture, and early 2000s pop diva culture. The label gained a lot of attention on Soundcloud and pretty soon A. G. Cook began producing for big name artists like Charli XCX. His work with Charli XCX specifically was where the term Hyperpop started being used to describe the maximalist blend of the chart-topping pop of Charli and the experimental electronic music of A. G. Cook.

                <p> Here's an example of A. G. Cook's work with Charli XCX from her 2017 album "Pop 2".
